## Functions, loops, object manipulation and Api fetching

- As part of the projects knowledge goals, the use of functions, loops and object manipulation was implemented.
  This methods were very important to develop a project of such a scope together with using asynchronous JavaScript
  that makes it even more challenging to develop.

## SEO and accessibility

- Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of orienting your website to rank higher on a search engine results page so that you receive more traffic. The aim is typically to rank on the first page of Google results for search terms that mean the most to your target audience. This application scores a high for SEO and accessibility on Google chrome's lighthouse.
